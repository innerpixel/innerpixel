    a decentralized community of innerpixels. ;-) More to come as the projects takes more form.

<h5>
  We are working on a decentralized service. Making the world a beter place, one innerpixel by one innerpixel. 
  <br>Empowering one innerpixel to interconnect with other innerpixel. 
  <br>While .. authenticity, freedom, privacy, safety and responsability.. being INNERPIXEL 
</h5>

<ul>
  Some predefined values. 
  <li>innerpixels have unlimited play ground; the <strong>0.INNERPIXEL.INSISTENCE </strong> provides infinity </li>
  <li>innerpixels are unlimited - innerpixels interact with innerpixels  </li>
  <li>Unlimited application.possibilities to ~ imagination: <br> ownership, anonymity, responsability.</li></ul>
</ul>

<ul>
Possible practical uses : 
<li> innerpixels can create and exchange innerpixels </li>
<li> en-content-ment: innerpixel can add content to innerpixels </li>
<li> create / receive / transfer/ etc  innerpixels to / from other innerpixels.</li>
